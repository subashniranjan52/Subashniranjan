            "\n",
            "This resume, while showcasing some positive aspects, needs significant revisions to effectively present the candidate's qualifications, especially for internships or full-time roles post-MIT.  It reads like a high school resume trying to adapt to college, but hasn't fully made the transition.\n",
            "\n",
            "**1. Strengths:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Strong academic background:** Valedictorian, high SAT/ACT scores, and attendance at MIT demonstrate academic excellence.\n",
            "* **Quantifiable achievements:**  The resume includes quantifiable results in the MIT Undergraduate Giving Campaign and High School Newspaper roles, which is a good start.\n",
            "* **Consistent formatting:** The resume maintains a consistent format throughout, making it easy to read.\n",
            "* **Variety of experiences:** The candidate demonstrates involvement in leadership, extracurricular activities, and work experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Weaknesses:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Unprofessional email address:** \"Freshman@mit.edu\" is not appropriate for a resume.\n",
            "* **Dorm address:** Using a dorm address appears temporary and unprofessional. A permanent address is preferred.\n",
            "* **Weak objective statement:**  The resume lacks a clear objective or summary statement outlining career goals.\n",
            "* **Unfocused experience:** The experiences listed are diverse but lack a cohesive narrative. It's unclear what career path the candidate is targeting.\n",
            "* **Underdeveloped descriptions:**  Bullet points under experiences are often too brief and lack detail.  They focus on tasks rather than accomplishments and impact.  For example, \"Organized a week-long schedule...\" doesn't tell us the *impact* of that organization.\n",
            "* **Irrelevant information:** Some information, such as listing all high school sports or the number of pages in the newspaper, is not relevant to career prospects.\n",
            "* **Skills section is too basic:**  Listing only Microsoft Office and generic carpentry skills is underwhelming for an MIT student.  Expected technical skills related to the Biology major are missing.\n",
            "* **Inconsistent capitalization and grammar:**  Inconsistencies in capitalization (e.g., \"T rained,\" \"Organized\") and minor grammatical errors detract from professionalism.\n",
            "* **Outdated high school information:** While acceptable for a freshman, the emphasis on high school achievements should diminish as the candidate progresses through college.  Focus should shift to college experiences.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Missing Sections:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Summary/Objective Statement:**  Crucial for framing the resume and highlighting key skills and career goals.\n",
            "* **Projects:**  For a technical field like Biology, projects (research, personal, coursework-based) are highly valuable and often more impactful than basic work experience.\n",
            "* **Technical Skills:**  Specific skills related to Biology (lab techniques, software, programming languages) are missing.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Suggestions for Improvement:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Replace the email address** with a professional one.\n",
            "* **Use a permanent address.**\n",
            "* **Develop a strong summary/objective statement** targeting a specific career area.\n",
            "* **Revise experience descriptions** to focus on accomplishments and quantifiable results using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).\n",
            "* **Add a \"Projects\" section** to showcase technical skills and accomplishments.\n",
            "* **Expand the \"Skills\" section** to include relevant technical skills (e.g., lab techniques, software, programming languages).\n",
            "* **Tailor the resume** to each specific job application.\n",
            "* **Proofread carefully** for grammar and consistency.\n",
            "* **Reduce emphasis on high school information** as college experience grows.\n",
            "* **Consider using a more modern resume template** for better visual appeal.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**5. Feedback on Clarity, Structure, and Tone:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Clarity:**  The resume lacks clarity in terms of career goals and the impact of experiences.\n",
            "* **Structure:** The structure is generally acceptable, but the content within each section needs improvement.\n",
            "* **Tone:** The tone is too passive and task-oriented.  It should be more active and results-oriented, showcasing the candidate's contributions and achievements.\n",
